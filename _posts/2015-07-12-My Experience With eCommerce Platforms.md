The past week was a very stressful, entertaining and educative for me. I started the week with a practically unusable laptop and mobile phone. One way or the other, they had both fallen down and gotten their screens ruined. I had to set aside some cash to repair my laptop during the week, and my phone is still crazy.

During the week, I had ideas for several ecommerce websites. I decided to experiment with 5 of the biggest ecommerce platforms in the world.

1. [Wordpress][1] with [Woocommerce][2]
2. [Magento][3] (Community Edition)
3. [Prestashop][4]
4. [Drupal][5] with [Drupal Commerce][6]
5. [OpenCart][7]
  
Now, there's something about me you need to know. I hate ready-made solutions. Whatever I'm working with, I need absolute control and flexibility. I need to be able to dig into hundreds of lines of codes and fit it to my standards. That's why you didn't see names like [Shopify][8] in the above list. Now, let's treat each of the 5 platforms above.

1. **Wordpress with Woocommerce**: I started working with WordPress 4 months ago (check out my WordPress blog at ). However, it's a CMS specially crafted for beginners. I'd love WordPress for simple blogging. After checking out WordPress with WooCommerce, I made up my mind against it for the simple reason that lot's of advanced features that come with eCommerce-specific platforms like OpenCart are additional paid plugins you would have to install with WordPress. Also, WordPress is a CMS, and in additional with WooCommerce, should be used for eCommerce stores with little or no advanced requirements. I have nothing against it except for the fact that it lacks advanced features.
2. **Magento (Community Edition)**: Yeah, Magento. The most popular and most advanced ecommerce platform in the world with big names such as Samsung and Ford as users (Enterprise editions of course). Magento has 3 editions: Community, Go and Enterprise editions. Community is free, while Enterprise goes for #15,000 per year - I meant $15,000 of course ;). After playing with magento and checking out what people have to say about it, I arrived at a decision. The issue of Magento requiring large computing resources to perform well is a commonly-shared opinion among Magento users, and I don't really have financial resources for dedicated servers/SSD hosting/Cloud hosting. Also, Magento plugins, templates and technical assistance do not come cheaply. Therefore, you get a free platform, but end up spending a hell lot on servers, plugins, templates and technical assistance. Scrapped out!
3. **OpenCart**: OpenCart was the most user-friendly among all ecommerce platforms I played with. It's free, and you get a beautiful default template. My major problem with OpenCart was the not-so-SEO-friendly urls you are left with. However, I would still recommend OpenCart for anyone willing to start an eCommerce website. It's pretty cool.
4. **Prestashop**: Prestashop is similar to OpenCart. It even has search-friendly URLs. However, it shares a fault with Magento: most PrestaShop plugins and templates are just too expensive. However, I'll also recommend it to anyone willing to kickstart an ecommerce website.
5. **Drupal with Drupal Commerce**: After playing out with lots of ecommerce platforms, Drupal with Drupal Commerce emerged as my favorite. I'll start a new project with Drupal Commerce tomorrow and hopefully, I'll finish in a month. Here are the reasons why Drupal with Drupal Commerce emerged as my favorite:
* I love Drupal. It's the most advanced and poweful CMS platform out there.
* I have a very high degree of control I don't normally have with OpenCart of PrestaShop.
* Drupal with Drupal Ecommerce helps me learn new stuffs. OpenCart and PrestaShop are really cool out-of-the-box. However, while working on projects, I love to learn as I work, and out-of-the-box solutions just don't help you learn as much as you would if you're building from scratch (e.g. I built this blog with a very lightweight CMS called CouchCMS, and it took me a week to set up, whereas I could have done the same with WordPress in 10 minutes or less). I don't enjoy spending much time on projects, but I do so for learning's sake.

I could give more reasons, but the third reason sums it up. OpenCart and PrestaShop are really awesome for beginners, but I'll offer myself a challenge by trying out Drupal with Drupal Commerce and see what I can do with it. Stay trippy!
