title: Blog Migration Complete
---

Yesterday, while reading [an article](https://alimanfoo.github.io/2017/01/23/go-faster-python.html) on [Alistair Miles'](https://alimanfoo.github.io/) blog,
 I found out that he was writing most of his posts in Jupyter Notebooks, exporting them as markdown and just publishing it
 with Jekyll + Github Pages. I thought that was an amazing and hassle-free blogging workflow, especially since my previous blog was built with Drupal 8, and I've spent a huge amount of time configuring databases, updating Drupal Core and Contrib modules,
 and doing a lot of stuff that isn't actually blogging.  
 This morning, I spent about an hour converting my existing articles to markdown (with [Heck Yes Markdown](http://heckyesmarkdown.com/)) and setting up my new Jekyll blog, hosted on
 Github Pages.  
 I think now, I can actually focus on generating high quality blog posts for my loyal readers.
